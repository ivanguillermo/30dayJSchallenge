    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Ivan Guillemro',

    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    captain.number = 99;
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should thi before using it.
